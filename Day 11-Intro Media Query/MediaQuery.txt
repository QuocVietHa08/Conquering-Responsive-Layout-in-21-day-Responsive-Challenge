-Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3
-It use the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.
-We can use Media query to add the breakpoint so that it becomes easy to customize your css code for you website.

-The most misunderstand about @media is min-width and max-width.
Ex : min-width:500px is 500px and bigger.
     max-width:500px is 500px and smaller.
-When using Media Query to make you website responsive, you should aways design for MOBILE FIRST.This will make the page display faster on smaller devices.
-You can add as many breakpoint that you can.
-There are tons of screen and devices with different height and widths,so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device.
-There are some rule when you what to set a breakpoint:
+ Small devices (phone,600px and down)					:max-width:600px
+ Small devices (portrait tablets and large phone, 600px and up) 	: min-width:600px;
+ Medium device (landscape tablet,768px and up) 			:min-width:768px;
+ Large devices (laptop,desktop ,992px and up) 				:min-width:992px;
+ Extra large devices (large laptop or desktop,1200px and up) 		:min-width:1200px;

-Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientaion of the browser.
-Another common use of media query,is to hide elements on different screen.
