 Why ems can be really dangerous.
- when em can be use to set font size, it will take it's parent font-size to set so it can be come really dangerous about it.
- when your div use em to set font-size and it have a lot of parent so choose em to custmize it may be not a good ideal, you should use rem instead of that.
- you can set the html font-size is 62,5% so 1rem == 10px.
