CSS units : vh ,vw,vmax,vmin.
-vh: view point height
-vw :view point width.
- when we set with % unit the children with have width or height that follow the % of its parent.
- But when we set with vh or vw unit , the attribute that we set will be that % of all width or all height.
-vmax : view point maxium if the width is longer or taller that the height the vmax will adjust acroding to it.
if the height is taller and longer that the height, it just adjust acroding thought the height.
- it really good for title.
